  - **Description:** I had the privilege of working on a project at PATADO ENGINEERING LIMITED aimed at enhancing the company's Inventory Management System. This project was crucial for improving operational efficiency and reducing costs.

  - **Outcome:**
    - As a result of these enhancements, the Inventory Management System became a central asset for PATADO ENGINEERING LIMITED's operations:
      - Order processing time reduced by 40%, leading to improved customer satisfaction.
